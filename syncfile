Added this line on the website, should not conflict with line I'll add at bottom. 

I created this text file on the desktop and saved to local github directory. Does it automatically sync to web? Yes it did.
Now making changes to try to create a conflict.

This line created on web to generate a conflict, but now I've resolved it.
